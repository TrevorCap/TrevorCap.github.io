        <h2>Methodology</h2>  
        <p>In <a href="https://fantasy.fangraphs.com/introducing-weighted-plate-discipline-index-wpdi-for-pitchers/">an article at FanGraphs.com</a> Ariel Cohen detailed an idea for indexing pitchers based on their plate discipline stats.
            I thought that this proposition was an incredible idea, but instead of being indexed against their perceived desirability, it would be prudent to weigh this directly to outcomes.
            As such, I decided to run a series of regressions for these outcomes to strikeout rates, walk rates, and strikeout minus walk rates.
            This data would be potentially relevant as it could help identify pitchers who are under or over performing relative to their plate discipline numbers.
          </p>
          
          <p>
           I determined that it would be prudent to regress this with both a linear model, and a more complicated machine learning model.
           For machine learning, I settled on the Random Forest Regression tool.
           This splits the data into smaller, random sections and then predicts using a series of decision trees based on that.
           This allows it to avoid overfitting, while still providing robust regressions.
           For more information read <a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/random-forest-regression-9871bc9a25eb">here</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>
              In order to determine whether this approach would be reasonable, I first downloaded data for all pitcher seasons (minimum 10 innings) from 2013 to 2018.
             I then used each linear and Random Forest Regression in order to create a model for determining whether it could accurately predict in sample metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
              For linear regression, I saw a .67 r<sup>2</sup> for K%, and an r<sup>2</sup> of .61 for K-BB%, and with the linear model completely unable to predict, even in-sample for the BB%.
              This was relatively encouraging for the linear model as it meant that 67% of the variation in an individual pitcher's strikeout rte could be determined based simply on their plate discipline numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the machine learning regression however, I saw a .93 r<sup>2</sup> for K%, r<sup>2</sup> of .89 for BB%, and an r<sup>2</sup> of .91 for K-BB% in-sample.
                This was encouraging, as it implied that based on on plate discipline numbers we could explain 90% of the varation in strikeout and walk rates, as well as the combined rate.
                However it is important to note that when tested in-sample it would be extremely unusual for a decision tree based algorithm to not have a strong relationship with the data it was 'taught' on.
                As such, we moved on to the data from 2019.
