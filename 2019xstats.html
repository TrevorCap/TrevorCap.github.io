    <p>When regresing the figures with the Random Forest Regressor, we are able to predict the strikeouts, walks, and combined strikeout minus walk rates for pitchers with limited data.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For expected strikeout rates we are able to use the data from April 2017, 2019 and come back with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.46.</p>
